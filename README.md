# SALES-DASHBOARD-ON-TABLEAU

I made the dashboard based on "Sales" data. I downloded the data from online sources and cleand it up by using Excel and i made the dashboard by using Tableau.
In this dashboard I made some chats and graphs for understanding the sales data easily.
On the top of the dashboard I created some KPIs where we can understand easily about the total and avg sales,profit,profit margin based on the period, category, segment and so on. i.e-If you want to see the segment wise total sales/profit then after selecting the specific segment you only can see the selecting segment wise sales or profit.
I used the Treemap for presenting Segment and Category wise sales/profit/profit margin.
I used Line chart for presenting Year wise sales/profit/profit margin and the maps to show the country wise sales/profit/profit margin.
